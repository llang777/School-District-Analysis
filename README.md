This code runs an in depth analysis on multiple aspects of school funding and performance, taking into account the financial support of schools, school type, and various academic testing scores. Using this, we can see the following:
1. Multiple factors contribute to student academic success, and academic achievement is not solely dependent on school funding. There are multiple high schools with low student funding amounts that still see high academic test results,
   and ones with high funding amount and low test results. This could be due to a difference in teaching styles, cultures, and student interest/engagment.
2. Charter schools perform at higher levels than district schools. The overall passing rate is noticibly higher, as well as the reading and math scores. School type seems strongly correlated with academic success.
3. Large schools seem to perform worse than small schools. Small schools score better, indicating they may be a better enviorment for learning. This could be due to multiple factors, such as a better student teacher ratio,
   cultural impacts, and greater ability to respond to student needs.

Overall, we can see multiple influences on the outcome of student testing scores, however more data across various categories would help create a more conclusive picture. The inclusion of cultural aspects, teaching methods, 
student to teacher ratio, parental support, student happiness, and peer support systems could help create a clearer picture into the various factors influencing student academic success.

This code contains the orignal starter code in some sections that was present in the notebook we were instructed to use for our project.
